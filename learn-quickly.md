Absolutely! I’d be happy to teach you how to play the piano from scratch, and I’ll guide you step by step in a quick and practical way. Here’s a beginner-friendly roadmap to get you started:

🎹 Week 1: Learn the Basics
Goal: Get comfortable with the layout of the piano and start playing simple melodies.

1. Understand the Keyboard Layout
The piano has repeating sets of 12 keys: 7 white and 5 black.

Look for groups of 2 and 3 black keys — they help you find your place.

Middle C is your anchor — find the group of 2 black keys in the middle and play the white key just to the left of them.

2. Finger Numbers
Both hands use fingers 1 to 5 (thumb = 1, pinky = 5).

Get used to placing each finger on a key.

3. Simple Exercises
Place right-hand fingers 1-5 on C-D-E-F-G.

Play slowly: C-D-E-F-G and back.

Do the same with the left hand: C-B-A-G-F.

🎵 Week 2: Simple Songs & Chords
Goal: Play simple songs and understand how chords work.

1. Play Simple Melodies
Try songs like:

“Mary Had a Little Lamb”

“Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”

Use just the right hand for now. I can give you sheet music or letter notes.

2. Basic Chords
Chords are 3 notes played together. Start with:

C major: C-E-G

F major: F-A-C

G major: G-B-D

Use your left hand for chords and right for melodies.

🎼 Week 3: Left + Right Hand Together
Goal: Combine melody and chords.

Play a simple melody with your right hand.

Add chords with your left hand at the beginning of each bar.

Example:

Melody: “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”

Chords: C – G – C

⏱ Tips for Learning Quickly
Practice 15–30 minutes daily.

Focus on coordination more than speed.

Use YouTube tutorials or piano apps (like Simply Piano or Flowkey) to supplement.
